# chmod-Calculator
This is a fork of a small chmod Calculator for Windows.
I updated the architecture to separate the logic from the presentation and cleaned up the design a little.

# Features
- Check the premissions you want to give.
- Get the octal premissions
- Get the rwx premissions
- Get the octal command, you only need to right the directory/file
- copy the command to the clipboard

# ToDo
- Add leading zero
- rewrite code (styling)
- comment the code^^
